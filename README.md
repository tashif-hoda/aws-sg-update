Script for updating an existing security group rule in AWS with your latest IP.
---------------------------
This script is for updating an existing security group rule in AWS with your latest IP. Use judicially.
Don't go around adding random public IP addresses (or do, I don't know, go crazy!!! (-^_^-) )          

Steps to Use:                                                                                          
1. Get security group ID from you AWS console and replace GROUP_ID here                                
2. Get the rule ID and update GROUP_RULE_ID of the rule you want to update with you IP                 
3. Edit the description if you want.                                                                   
4. Change the region to wherever the parent VPC of the security group sits.                            
5. Enjoy the bliss of updating your IP to the security group in the least amount of clicks possible!!!
